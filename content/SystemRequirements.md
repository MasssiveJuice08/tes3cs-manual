# System Requirements

&nbsp;

Win95/98/2000/Me, 128 MB RAM, and hard drive space for game data files. It is recommended that it be run at 1024x768 or higher.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Direct3D is used for all 3D rendering. Since the Construction Set renders in a window, only those video cards that support accelerated window rendering are recommended. It also uses hardware acceleration for bilinear filtering, transforms, and lighting.

&nbsp;

A 3D accelerated video card is not necessary to run the Construction Set, but it is highly recommended.

&nbsp;

You can obtain better performance from the rendering a few ways:

&#49;.&nbsp; &nbsp; Buy a better video card.

&#50;.&nbsp; &nbsp; Decrease the size of the render window.

&#51;.&nbsp; &nbsp; Turn Mip-Maps off in Properties.

&#52;.&nbsp; &nbsp; Turn down the render distance in Properties.

&#53;.&nbsp; &nbsp; Make sure the fogging option is OFF.

&#54;.&nbsp; &nbsp; Buy a better video card.

&nbsp;

If you have done a Maximum install of the Construction Set, you may notice it (and *Morrowind* the game) take longer to load. This is because both programs will use the raw version of the art, instead of compressed artwork. This takes longer to load.
