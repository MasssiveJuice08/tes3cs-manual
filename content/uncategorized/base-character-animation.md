Here are the file names that are included with a brief explanation of what they do:

**Male Base animations** – This file contains the animations for every **humanoid** NPC in the game, as well as the Player when viewed in 3rd &nbsp; person mode. &nbsp; If you select this file in the editor, you can see the name of each animation and the frame at which the animation occurs.

**Male Base animations (1st person)** – This file contains all the base animations for the Player Character as viewed in First Person. &nbsp; All male players will use this file.

**Female Base animations** – These will override any male animations if they are labeled in this file for humanoids only.

**Female Base animations (1st person)** – Any animations include here will override the male version for **humanoid** Players.

**Khajiit/Argonian Base animations** – This file contains all the animations for the **beast races** - male and female, NPC and Player alike.

**Khajiit/Argonian Base animations (1st person)** – Any animations included in this file will overwrite the 1st person animations from the male **and** female 1st person files.

**Argonian Swim Base animation** – This file will overwrite the beast race base animation for[^1] **Argonian** NPC’s and Player Characters only.

[^1]: Originally a line break occurred here before "...**Argonian** NPC's and...", breaking up the sentence. This was likely an editing mistake, mistaking the bolded word "**Argonian**" for a new animation type as each entry otherwise starts with a bolded phrase. The line break has been omitted here for readability's sake.
