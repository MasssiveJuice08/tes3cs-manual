This window allows you to see a preview of the art for your selected object. You can also play the object’s animation. When selected, the Render Window will actually change into the Preview Window. &nbsp; The object currently selected in the Object Window will then be displayed. &nbsp; Closing the Preview Window will restore the Render Window.

## Rotating the Object  
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to rotate the object in the window.

## Viewing the Animation  
If the object has any animation attached to it, buttons will appear at the top of the window that allow you to play, rewind, and pause the animation. The current frame and number of frames in the animation will also be shown. 

## Viewing a new Model  
You can right click the preview window to load/view a new model. This DOES NOT make the currently selected object use this model; it is only for viewing purposes.
