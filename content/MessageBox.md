MessageBox, “Message”, \[var1\], \[var2\], \[“button1”\], \[“button2”\]

&nbsp;

MessageBox, “This is a Message”

MessageBox, "Shall I start to spin? GameHour = %.2f", GameHour, "OK", "No Way"

&nbsp;

Displays a message on the screen. There are two basic types of MessageBoxes.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&#49;.&nbsp; &nbsp; One that displays just text. This is displayed at the bottom of the screen and will go away in a small amount of time.

&#50;.&nbsp; &nbsp; One that displays buttons the player can choose. This box stops time and displays itself in the center of the screen until the player chooses an option.

&nbsp;

Variable names can also be passed into the MessageBox command. These are displayed in the order they are used as parameters. The message must say *how* the variable is to be displayed.

&nbsp;

| **Notation** | **Variable type** |
| --- | --- |
| f | Float |
| D | Short or Long |
| S | string |


&nbsp;

Float variables must also specify how many decimal places they should show.

&nbsp;

Either type of MessageBox can display variables.

&nbsp;

See the sample script “MessageTest”.
