Lets the creator decide what TES’ are loaded and which is the active one.

_TES Files._ This is a list of all of the TES files in the Morrowind\\Data Files directory. The checked ones are the ones currently loaded. Double Clicking on one will change its state from loaded to unloaded. &nbsp; The Active esp file is shown as “Active File” in the Status column.

_Set as Active File:_ Makes the currently selected file active.

_Merge to Masters:_ Combines the active esp file to its masters. It also prompts you for the file that any new data should go into. After a file is merged, it is deleted.

_Details:_ Opens a detail window for the currently selected TES file showing the actual chunk and form data that is contained. So if a new sword ID is added it will be listed, or if one is deleted, etc.

_Created By:_ Creator’s name

_Summary:_ A summary of what the TES file does and perhaps how some of the more complicated sections work.

_Parent Masters:_ displays the master files the currently selected file is based on.
