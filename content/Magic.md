Magic in Morrowind is made of up magic effects. Magic effects are the basic building blocks of all the magic in the game. This includes spellmaking, alchemy, and enchanting. The settings for each magic effect are:

_Scale Speed:_ Speed multiplier for how fast the effect travels.

_Scale Size:_ Set how much the visual effect should scale based on its magnitude.

_Size Cap:_ The largest multiplier the effect can be scaled by.

_School:_ The school skill used for casting this effect.

_Base Cost_: The effect cost used in all magic formulas.

_Particle Texture_: The particle texture that you see in the game.

_Effect Icon_: The magic menu icon for the magic effect.

_Description_: Describes how to use the magic effect and how it works.

_Creation Modes_: Flag Spellmaking and/or Enchanting to make the magic effect available for making spells or enchanting items.

_Casting Effects_: Select Sound and Visual files for effects when casting.

_Bolt Effects_: Select Sound and Visual files for bolt effects.

_Hit Effects_: Select Sound and Visual files for hit effects.

_Area Effects_: Select Sound and Visual files for area effects.

_Scale_:

_Speed_ - Speed multiplier for how fast the effect travels.

_Size_ - Set how much the visual effect should scale based on its magnitude.

_Size Cap_ - The largest multiplier the effect can be scaled by.

_Lighting Effect_:

_RGB values_: Choose the color the magic effect adds to the world.

_Fire_: Use this flag if the 3D object used for the light has particles attached to it. This tells the game to stop the particles when the fire time is used up.

_Flicker_: Makes the magic effect’s lighting “flicker”, or randomly change its brightness.

_Negative_: If checked, this makes the lighting “dark”. The color you selected for the light will be removed from the world, not added. So a white negative light will act like a black light.

_Dynamic_: If checked, this tells the lighting to light up any dynamic or moving objects (such as characters and creatures). Dynamic lights slow the game down a little more.
