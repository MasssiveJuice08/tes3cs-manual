OnActivate

If ( OnActivate == 1)

&nbsp;

This function returns TRUE if the calling object has been activated. If you use this function in a script, it *overrides* the objects default activation. The system assumes you will be filling in the code to make the object do what you want it to do.

&nbsp;

To use the default objectâ€™s activation you must call [[gameplay/scripting/functions/activate|activate]] on it.

&nbsp;

Note that the [[activator]] type of object has NO default activation.
