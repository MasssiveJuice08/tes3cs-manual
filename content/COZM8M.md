Characters and Creatures provide the backbone for the entire game experience. They also contain most of the gameplay information. This includes AI, combat, and dialogue.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The combined set of Characters and Creatures are often referred to as Actors.

&nbsp;

All Actors can perform the same basic actions like combat, moving, magic, etc.

&nbsp;

Here are the major differences:

&nbsp;

| **Item** | **Character** | **Creature** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Animation** | All use the same file, called the base\_anim. | Most use their own animation file specific for themselves and can only perform the actions animated for them. Creatures tagged as “biped” can use animations in the base\_anim. |
| **Movement** | All characters can walk and swim | Can be tagged to walk, fly, swim, or not move. |
| **Dialogue** | All characters have dialogue by default | Creatures only have dialogue if you specifically tag it to them. |
| **Stats** | Characters have race, class, factions, etc. | Creatures do not have a race, class, or faction. |
| **Skills** | Characters get all 27 skills. | Creatures have only 3 skills, that encompass the whole set of 27. |
| **Items** | Characters can use all their items, and will select what weapons to use and clothes to wear. | Creatures cannot use their inventory. “Biped” creatures can use weapons and shields, but nothing else. |
