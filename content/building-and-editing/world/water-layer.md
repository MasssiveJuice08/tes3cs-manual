All exterior cells have a water layer that cuts through them at a height of 0. This is the ocean.

Interior cells can have a water layer as well, and can also have the height specified in the properties for that cell.

The water layer is the only type of liquid that characters can swim in.

Lava or other visual water is defined as activators.
