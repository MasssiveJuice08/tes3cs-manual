## Cell Overview

Think of a cell as a mini-map. The entire game is made up of cells, for a huge continuous world. As the player moves around, cells are loaded and unloaded from the game.

There are two types of cells, exterior cells and interior cells.

### **[[exterior-cell|Exterior Cells]]**

The exterior cells are basically a grid that extends infinitely in all directions.

### **[[interior-cell|Interior Cells]]**

Interior Cells are entered through the exterior. When in an interior, the exterior world is no longer visible. Each interior cell is essentially itâ€™s own universe.
