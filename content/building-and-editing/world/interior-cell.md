Interior Cells are entered through the exterior. When in an interior, the exterior world is no longer visible. Each interior cell is essentially it’s own universe.

Each interior cell gets a **[[naming-cells|unique name]]**. Interior cells also are *not* affected by weather or time of day, and all have their own settings for ambient, sun, fog colors, water level, and sleeping.
