&nbsp;

Opens the faction window, where factions and their properties can be defined. The main things that are defined are what the requirements are for each rank in terms of skills and traits, and the disposition of this faction towards other factions. Everything else for the faction must be checked in the individual NPCs. This includes the actual tasks to be given a rank increase and the actual services.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The NPCs can reference the data seen here. For example, Misa Drora, a member of The New&nbsp;

Temple, can check to see if the PCâ€™s skills meet the requirements for rank 3, and offer a quest if they do. If they do not meet the requirements, she can say so without giving specifics. She can mention the skills and such that are important, if she is scripted to do so.
