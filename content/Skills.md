Costing data for all the skills. Use Values, governing attributes, etc. The skill list is static for the game. Skills cannot be added since their uses are coded into the game.

&nbsp;

*Skill:* The current skill being edited.

&nbsp;

*Governing Attribute:* The attribute that governs this skill. Governing attributes get raised when level increases and act as a ceiling for training that skill.

&nbsp;

*Specialization:* The overall class for this skill. Combat, Magic, Stealth

&nbsp;

*Actions:* These cannot be edited (use values can). But a skill can have up to four hard-coded actions that the game uses the skill for. An example would be that Athletics is used for the actions of Single Jump and Second of Run.

&nbsp;

*Use Value:* The multiplier on the single action for how many uses it is worth. Need x number of uses to reach x level.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

*Description:* Text description of the skill. Displayed in selection and stats screen of the game.
