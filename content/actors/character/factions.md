Opens the faction window, where factions and their properties can be defined. The main things that are defined are what the requirements are for each rank in terms of skills and traits, and the disposition of this faction towards other factions. Everything else for the faction must be checked in the individual NPCs. This includes the actual tasks to be given a rank increase and the actual services.

The NPCs can reference the data seen here. For example, Misa Drora, a member of The New  
Temple, can check to see if the PCâ€™s skills meet the requirements for rank 3, and offer a quest if they do. If they do not meet the requirements, she can say so without giving specifics. She can mention the skills and such that are important, if she is scripted to do so.

_Name:_ The name of the faction as it appears to the player. (character limit: 32)

_New:_ Creates a new faction.

_Favored Skills:_ The entire list of skills with favored ones highlighted (these are also moved to the top, so they can be seen easily).

_Rank Name:_ List of rank names. If edited here, they trickle down to duplicate locations of that rank.

_Attribute:_ There are two of these. For each rank, the attribute level must be reached.

_Primary Skill:_ The value that at least one of the favored skills must reach for rank advancement.

_Favored Skill:_ The value that all of the favored skills must reach for rank advancement.

_Hidden from PC:_ The faction will not be displayed to the player during the game.

_Reaction List:_ List of selected factions and the base disposition of this faction towards them.
