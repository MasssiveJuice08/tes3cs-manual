Wander is the most popular form of AI, causing an actor to move around at random. Actors will intelligently choose points to walk to based in the path grid of the cell they are in.

## Idle Chances  
This is the percentage chance the actor will stand still and perform the particular idle. Each idle is checked, and the one that passes with the highest roll is played. If no Idle passes the random roll, the Actor will move (walk).

&nbsp; &nbsp; The Idles are:  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Idle2: &nbsp; Looking around  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Idle3: &nbsp; Looking behind  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Idle4: &nbsp; Scratching head  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Idle5: &nbsp; Shifting clothing or armor on shoulder  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Idle6: &nbsp; Rubbing hands together and showing wares  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Idle7: &nbsp; Looking at fingers and looking around furtively  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Idle8: &nbsp; Deep thought  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Idle9: &nbsp; Reaching for weapon
