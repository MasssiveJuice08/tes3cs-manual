## Alarm  
This returns the base value of the speaker's Alarm AI Setting.  

## Alarmed  
This is 1 if the speaker is currently Alarmed (has detected a crime) and 0 otherwise.  

## Attacked  
This is 1 if the speaker has ever been attacked, and 0 otherwise.  

## Choice  
This works with a command in the results field called "Choice." When the function "choice" appears in the results field, the game searches the current topic again, this time setting the value of "choice" to whatever number the player selected. Just like a regular search, it stops at the first response for which all conditions are true (so it may not necessarily hit the response you expect).

Warning: Make sure any choices you make are "reachable" or you can send the game into an infinite loop. For instance, if you had "Choice One 1 Two 2" and no other responses in that topic, the game would default to displaying the choice again. And again. And again.

## Creature Target  
Returns true (1) if the speaker is targeting a creature.  

## Detected  
This is 1 if the speaker detects the player and 0 otherwise.  

## Function Faction Rank Difference  
This is the player's rank in the speaker's faction minus the speaker's rank. Note that the first rank in a faction is 0 and your "rank" is â€“1 if you do not belong to that faction. A return value of 0 is the same rank, 1 is PC is one rank higher, -2 is PC is two ranks lower.

## Fight  
This is the AI Fight Setting of the speaker. This is the base value, not the value after disposition, distance, crime level, and so on have been added.  

## Flee

## Hello

## Level  
This is the current level of the speaker.  

## PC Acrobatics  
This is the player's current skill level in Acrobatics. There are other functions for the player's skills and attributes. They all work the same way. All of them return the current value of the attribute or skill, which includes disease, magical enhancements, etc.  

## Blight Disease  
This is 1 if the player has a blight disease and 0 otherwise.  

## PC Clothing Modifier  
This is the total value of all the clothing and armor the player is wearing. The value of your equipment changes the disposition of people in the game.

## PC Expelled  
This returns 1 if the player is expelled from the speaker's faction and 0 otherwise.  

## PC Level

This returns 2 if you have the Faction Reputation, but do not meet the skill requirements.  
This returns 3 if you qualify.
