StartScript, ScriptName  

StartScript, GrandCouncil  

This function starts a script running. This is a Global script. It is not attached to any object, so functions like moving, rotating, checking distances and such have no bearing in a global script.

Global scripts are good for running complex quests, checking variables, or setting timers.
