Move &nbsp; &nbsp; x, 100  

Moves the object along the selected axis (x, y, or z) at the speed selected. This speed is in units per second (21.3 units per foot). This movement is based on the objectâ€™s local rotation. Thus, a positive y movement will always move the object along its local forward vector.
