MoveWorld axis, units/sec  
MoveWorld z, 100  

Moves the object along the selected world axis (x, y, or z) at the speed selected. This speed is in units per second (21.3 units per foot). This movement is based on the world axis, thus a positive z movement will always move the object up, regardless of itâ€™s local rotation.
