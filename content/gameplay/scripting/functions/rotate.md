Rotate &nbsp; &nbsp; axis, degrees/sec  
Rotate &nbsp; &nbsp; x, 100  

Rotates the [[objects/index|object]] along the selected axis (x, y, or z) at the speed selected. This speed is in degrees per second. This movement is based on the objectâ€™s local rotation. Thus, a positive y movement will always rotate the object along its local forward vector.
