The Regions window allows the user to set and edit different regions, which are areas of the exterior world with unique weather and ambient sounds.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Weather Chances**

This section contains the percent chances that the different weather types will occur in the region.&nbsp; Any weather types set to 0 will never occur.

&nbsp;

**Sleep Creature**

Whenever you rest in an exterior cell there is a percent chance that your rest will be interrupted by a creature.&nbsp; The Leveled Creature selected in this field is what will be used to calculate what creature awakes you.

&nbsp;

**Region Map Color**

Different colors can be assigned for the Region Map, which can be accessed by clicking on the “Region Paint” button.&nbsp; This brings up a new window showing the exterior world. Highlighting a region in the list on the right brings up the region’s information below; clicking on exterior cells on the map to the left then includes those cells in that region. The cells’ color on the map will change to match the region color.

&nbsp;

**Ambient Sounds**

The Sound files are listed in the table on the right side of the window, and can be filtered by three fields:\
&nbsp;

*Chance:* This is the percent chance the sound will play.

&nbsp;

*Priority:* If two sounds are called at once, the sound with the higher priority will play.

&nbsp;

*Sound ID:* the ID of the sound file.
