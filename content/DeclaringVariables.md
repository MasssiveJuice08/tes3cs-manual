**Reserved variables for companions**

*short&nbsp; &nbsp; stayOutside*

When this value is 1 the followers in the PC’s group will wait outside the interiors for him to come back out.

&nbsp;

*short&nbsp; &nbsp; companion*

When this value is 1 you will be given a companion inventory menu selected by dialogue. If the creature doesn’t talk, he is alive, and you activate him you will be taken directly to the companion inventory menu.

&nbsp;

*float&nbsp; &nbsp; minimumprofit*

This is how much of the PC’s stuff this bounty hunter is carrying. The value gets modified every time an item is dropped on or removed from the companion inventory menu.
