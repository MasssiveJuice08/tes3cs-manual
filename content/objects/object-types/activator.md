An activator is any object that does something in the world, but cannot be picked up. Signs, flags, levers, pressure plates, etc. It may give off sound, flash lights, and any number of effects. Activators can also be given animation.

An activator will also show up in the world with a text label if it is given a “name”. It can still be activated (provided the script is written for this case).

A popular use of the name field for an activator is to label signs and such.

_Count_: Number of times the object is placed in the game world

_Name:_ The object’s name. This is what appears in the game to player. (character limit: 32)

_Script_: The script assigned to object.

_Add Art File_: Art used for object.

_Animation:_ Animation used for object.

_References Persist_: If checked, the object will remain persistent in world.

_Blocked:_ If checked, the specific object becomes read-only.
