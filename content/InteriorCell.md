Interior Cells are entered through the exterior. When in an interior, the exterior world is no longer visible. Each interior cell is essentially itâ€™s own universe.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Each interior cell gets a [**unique name**](<NamingCells.md>). Interior cells also are *not* affected by weather or time of day, and all have their own settings for ambient, sun, fog colors, water level, and sleeping.
