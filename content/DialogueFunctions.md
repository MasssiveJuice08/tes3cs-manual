**Alarm**

This returns the base value of the speaker's Alarm AI Setting.

&nbsp;

**Alarmed**

This is 1 if the speaker is currently Alarmed (has detected a crime) and 0 otherwise.

&nbsp;

**Attacked**

This is 1 if the speaker has ever been attacked, and 0 otherwise.

&nbsp;

**Choice**

This works with a command in the results field called "Choice." When the function "choice" appears in the results field, the game searches the current topic again, this time setting the value of "choice" to whatever number the player selected. Just like a regular search, it stops at the first response for which all conditions are true (so it may not necessarily hit the response you expect).

&nbsp;

Warning: Make sure any choices you make are "reachable" or you can send the game into an infinite loop. For instance, if you had "Choice One 1 Two 2" and no other responses in that topic, the game would default to displaying the choice again. And again. And again.

&nbsp;
