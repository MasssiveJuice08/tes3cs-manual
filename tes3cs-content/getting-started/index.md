## The Elder Scrolls Construction Set

_The Elder Scrolls Construction Set_ allows you to edit and create any data for use with _The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind_. Any data that goes into the game goes in through the Construction set and is stored in [[data-files/index|data files]] (labeled either ESM or ESP files) that are read by the game.

The Construction Set allows you to create your own areas (towns, dungeons, islands, etc) and populate them with [[actors/character/index|characters]], [[creature|creatures]], and [[actors/dialogue/index|stories]].

You can add new [[race|races]], [[class|classes]], [[spellmaking|spells]], [[alchemy|potions]], [[enchanting|magic items]], and anything else your mind can dream up.

You can also edit the data that comes with _Morrowind_. Don’t like how fast everyone moves? Change the [[gameplay/index|movement settings]]. Do you want Nords to start with better abilities? Want to rebalance spell costs? It’s all here.

The most powerful feature of the Construction Set is the ability to create new data and stories, which are stored as plug-in files. You can place your plug-in on the Internet and have others play the quests and areas you have created. And since they are plug-ins, they add directly into someone’s existing game without damaging the data already there.
