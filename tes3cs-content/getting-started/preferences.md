## Grid Snap / Use Grid  
When Use Grid is checked, objects shown in the [[the-render-window|Render Window]] move only by the number of units in the “Grid Snap” field. &nbsp; This can be helpful when lining up room pieces. &nbsp; Multiples of 8 are effective with the original objects (32, 64, 128).

## Angle Snap / Use Angle  
When “Use Angle” is checked, objects in the Render Window will rotate as many degrees as are specified in the “Angle Snap” field. &nbsp; Again, this is helpful when attempting to line up many objects.

## Cell Load Settings  
“Allow Render Window Cell Loads” will load the full cell every time the user selects an object in a cell adjacent to the [[exterior-cell|exterior cell]] currently being worked on.  
“Skip Initial Cell Load” will prevent the editor from loading the first cell in the list into the Render Window when an esm/ess file is loaded.

## Movement Speeds  
Numbers can be entered to change the speed at which the user rotates and moves both the camera and objects. &nbsp; The default values are 1.00.

## View Settings  
The slider bar in this section controls how much of the loaded cell will be visible in the Render Window. &nbsp; The farther towards “far” the slider is set, the more can be seen from any given camera position, which may slow down some systems. &nbsp; The “Renderer Settings” button brings up options for display device used by the Editor.

## Auto Save  
When checked, this option automatically backs up the user’s work on a regular basis, as specified by the number of minutes entered. &nbsp; This backup file is called AutoSave.bak and is a regular plugin. Just rename it to restore your work.
