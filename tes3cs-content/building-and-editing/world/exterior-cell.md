The exterior cells are basically a grid that extends infinitely in all directions. Each exterior cell is 8192 units by 8192 units or 385 feet by 385 feet.

All exterior cells are given a [[naming-cells|name]], but it **does not have to be unique**. This is the name that will appear in the player’s map window as they walk around the world. Some cities and towns will exist over several cells, and we don’t want the name of the cell changing as they walk across the city. All exterior cells are named based on the [[regions|region]] they are part of by default.

All exterior cells are automatically given a grid number that represents their X,Y position from the center of the world. You will see this in the [[the-render-window|render window]] title as you select objects.

Settings are also available for Weather Type, sleeping, and designation on the World Map using a colored border.
