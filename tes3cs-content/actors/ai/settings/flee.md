This is used in determining how apt the [[actors/index|actor]] is to flee. It is used in a much larger AI strategy that will not be documented in this help file.

Setting it to 100 will make the actor more likely to flee, but this may not always be the result, as the Actor will also use other factors like how much damage they can give out, or other strategies they may use such as [[magic]] and ranged combat.
